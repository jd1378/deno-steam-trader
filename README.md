# deno-steam-trader

This is a steam trading library built for deno. I have followed [DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager)'s library in a lot of features/functions in my library. However I have changed and improved some parts of it to my liking. This library is not tested and not used by myself **yet** (I use the DoctorMcKay's myself right now).

Currently only polling is supported (no steam-user like functionality).

The aim of this project was to improve security of the bot using deno's permission system.

Currently I don't have enough time to support this project due to personal life issues (I wont be available since ~ 20 FEB 2021 till around 2022). But I will try to merge pull requests if any is made after the end of march.

## Usage

by using the exported `createTradeManager` function you can easily get it up and running through ts types I guess. I will add more docs as soon as I have the time.
